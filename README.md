This is a simple tool for calculating what bitrate you should use when encoding video. This is by no means an exhaustive guide to video encoding and the number it spits out may not be applicable in all situations.

## Who is this for?

People who edit video but don't like to think about the math when they are encoding.

Example: "This website has an upload limit of 2GB. How can I make my vido only 2GB? Maybe I should just choose a random bitrate, try encoding it, and see what filesize comes out? And repeat that over and over again until I get to less than 2GB?"

## Ideas for future features

- A placebo field for width and height resolution for video
- Math adjustments for different types of codecs
- An interface that updates the result automatically as you type in
- Sliders for the input fields for ease of adjustment
